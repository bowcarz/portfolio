# About Me
My name is Bartosz Owcarz. I have an engineer degree specializing in web application programming. At the age of 8 I've got my first console - PlayStation 2, while at the age of 9 I got my first computer and since then the interest in this subject has only increased. From an early age, I was interested in testing, ranging from testing hardware to minor troubleshooting. Now my goal is to develop testing knowledge and improve my technical skills.
